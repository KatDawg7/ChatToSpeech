##Chat to Speech
v 1.0.0-beta

###Synopsis
CTS is a chrome extension that will read twitch chat out loud using chrome's text-to-speech API.

This is my first chrome extension and also my first time coding in Javascript. Needless to say, I'm still learning, so any help, tips, or suggestions are encouraged and greatly appreciated!

###Motivation
The idea behind the creation of CTS is to help twitch streamers read and interact with their chat while still focusing on gameplay. 

###Installation
You can either download the extension from the chrome web store or...
  1. download the CTS files
  2. in chrome://extensions/ select the 'Developer mode' checkbox
  3. select the 'Load unpacked extension...' button and select the location where you downloaded the CTS files
  4. I think that's it

###Help/Contribute
I've had a lot of fun working on this project, but, like I said earlier, I am still learning and would greatly appreciate your input and advice.
